# Stormground in VSCode

## How to use

If you don't have a Stormground project already, you can run the `Stormground: New Project` command.

Once the extension recognizes you are in a Stormground workspace, it will automatically check and and ask if you want to configure the project (this is necessary to run your project).
You can manually configure a Stormground workspace with the `Stormground: Configure Project` command.

If your project is configured, a button in the status bar will appear allowing you to run the project.
You can also run the project via the `Stormground: Run Project` command.
